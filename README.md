To use:

* run `./MAKE-REFERENCE.sh` which takes the instructor supplied files, plus the
  reference implementation which is in: `REFERENCE-SOLUTION` and produces a subdirectory:
  `diffs.sh-reference` which contains the "expected" results for `stdout`, `stderr`, and return codes
  for each line that is annotated as a test inside `diffs.sh`
